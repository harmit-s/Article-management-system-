# Develop a dashboard to manage articles with these rules:

-There is no API. You have to mock the API in a separate layer in the code. So, we -can replace it with a real API without touching other parts of your code.
-The edit page and Delete confirmation dialog need to be included.
-You must check user mistakes on filling in forms (like email address, required fields, etc.).
-Protected pages should not be available for guest users.
-Wysiwyg editor is not required.
-Tags field is a combobox which you can select some tags or use custom tags.
-Design them based on your assumption

# General Requirements
-Use ReactJS
-Write necessary tests, but not with high coverage.
-Remove all unused codes if you use a boilerplate or framework.
-Write an instruction to run the project.
-All pages and components should be responsive.
-Do anything else that can impress us, but don’t overwork.
-You should use a linter like PrettierJS or any others.
-Don’t commit the .vscode or .idea directory.
-Mention the required NodeJS version
